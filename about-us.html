					<p>
					OddBox Games was founded by Keelan Falk and Colton Flick. We've known each
					other since middle school, and OddBox is a continuation of a friendship
					that spans ten years, all four Super Smash Brothers games, and a lot of
					pizza. We named the company after an old box we found in Keelan's basement.
					It's catchy. We launched our first product, Terrible Lizards, in 2015 via
					Kickstarter, and we're in the process of developing a few more entries in
					the OddBox lineup. Stay tuned for more information!
					OddBox is based in Raleigh, North Carolina.
