				The dinosaurs are the greatest tragedy the world has ever known. For
				millions of years, the reptilian titans ruled the earth, crushing any
				creature that dared cross their path. Fast forward to the present. The
				dinosaurs have suffered a terrible humiliation, all that remains of the
				noble lizards is a creature called a &ldquo;chicken,&rdquo; a ball of meat,
				with delicious legs and a tiny head. But no longer! The time for
				de-evolution has come! With your help, the dinosaurs can rise again,
				piece by piece.
				</p>
				<p>
				Terrible Lizards is a competitive card game for 2-4 players where you build
				your own custom dinosaur and battle to be the last lizard standing. You
				don't have to collect a ton of cards or buy packs to get rare cards here.
				All you need is the game and some friends to play with! The game is
				entirely self contained, with over a dozen dinosaurs and tons of crazy
				effects. Team up with your friends, or take them down! You can get some
				more information on our Kickstarter.
