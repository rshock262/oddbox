				<h3>Beginning the game</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					Each player is dealt a five card hand. The cards in your hand are secret; don’t show them to
					other players. Once the cards are dealt, choose someone to go first. Play then proceeds in
					clockwise order. Each player starts with fifty health. When your health reaches zero, your
					dinosaur dies. When a dinosaur dies, all of their active effects end and all cards in their
					possession are placed in the discard pile. The last dinosaur standing is the winner.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Turn Structure</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
						When a player’s turn begins, if they have fewer than five cards in hand, they may choose to
						draw until they have up to 5 cards.
						During a player’s turn, they have two actions. Players may use an action to attach a part card
						from their hand to their dinosaur, play an effect card from their hand, or discard a card,
						moving it directly from their hand to the discard pile.
						Once a player has either used all of their allotted actions, or decided that they do not want to
						use all of their actions, they may choose to attack an opponent, which will be covered in a
						later section. If the player has fewer than five cards in hand after attacking (or choosing not
						to), they may once again draw until they have up to five cards. If a player has more than five
						cards in hand as their turn ends, they must discard cards until they have five cards in hand.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Building a Terrible Lizard</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					There are five types of body part, Head, Body, Arms, Legs, and Wings. A player may only have one part
					of each type attached to their dinosaur at any given time.
					As said previously, on a players turn, they may spend one action to attach a part from their hand to their dinosaur.
					The player may replace existing parts currently on their dinosaur. Parts that are replaced are discarded.
					It does not cost an action to discard parts in this way.
					While it doesn't technically influence the game, a major part of the fun of Terrible Lizards is physically assembling your dinosaur.
					Arrange the parts on the table to form your lizard!
					If your dinosaur has all four parts of a single dinosaur, your dinosaur gets the set bonus of that dinosaur (see "Set Bonsuses").
				</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Attacking</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					To attack, add the total attack value of all of the parts currently on your dinosaur
					(indicated by the number next to the claw icon on each part, pictured at right), and
					choose a dinosaur to attack, then roll the die. Add the number rolled to the previous
					attack total. Then, subtract the total weight (indicated by the number next to the
					anvil icon, also at right) of all parts of the defending dinosaur. The resulting number
					is the amount of damage done. The defending dinosaur loses health equal to the
					damage dealt. You cannot deal less than zero damage. If the damage dealt would
					be a negative number, deal zero damage instead.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Effects</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					When an effect card is played, immediately resolve the text on the card, then place it in the
					discard pile. If an effect contradicts the rules, follow the instructions of the effect.
					There are three types of effects: Standard, Quick, and Persistent.
					Standard effects are tan. Once a standard effect is used, it is immediately discarded. These
					can only be played on your turn.
					Quick effects are red, and have the symbol at right in their top left corner. On your
					turn, you may play a Quick effect just like a standard effect. You may play Quick
					effects during an opponent’s turn at no cost.
					Persistent effects are purple, and have the symbol at the right in their top left corner.
					Once played, these remain on the table, face up and in play. Whatever effect a
					Persistent effect has takes effect so long as the card is in play. Once it is discarded
					or leaves your control, the effect ends. A player may may have up to two Persistent
					effects in play under their control at any given time. A player may replace their Persistent
					effect with another Persistent effect, in which case the replaced effect will be discarded at no
					cost. A player may choose to discard one of their Persistent effects from play during their turn.
					Discarding a Persistent effect from play does not cost an action.
				</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Misc.</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					If a card is “suppressed”, treat it as if it is not in play until the suppression ends. Once
					suppression ends, the card returns to play exactly as it was. If this is no longer a legal move
					(for example, if a Persistent effect was suppressed, then another Persistent effect was played
					in its place, then the suppression ended, causing three Persistent effects to be simultaneously
					in play under one player’s control) then one of the conflicting cards must be discarded. The
					player whose cards conflict may choose which to discard.
					If the deck runs out during play, shuffle the discard pile and flip it back over. Or, if you prefer,
					you may also choose to play out the remainder of the game without drawing new cards.
					Whomever is last in play order is the first person to attack. For example, in a two player
					game, the player who goes first does not get to attack at the end of their first turn. However,
					the second player may attack at the end of their first turn. In a three player game, the third
					player is the first to be able to attack, and in a four player game, the fourth player is the first to
					be able to attack, etc..
					Players may only draw cards at the beginning or end of their turn, unless a card indicates
					otherwise.
					A player is not required to play any cards on their turn.
					A player is not required to attack on their turn.
					If a card gets stolen using another effect card, like Spy-nosaur, it still costs an action.
					An attack which does no damage is different from an attack that does zero damage. An attack
					that does zero damage is still considered to have done damage.
					For example, if you have the
					Persistent effect Venomous, and your opponent dodges your attack using Wings, they have
					taken no damage, and thus, Venomous will not take effect. However, if you attack them, and
					their Weight is high enough that your attack does zero damage, Venomous will take effect.
					If you play a card in response to another card being played, that card resolves before the card
					it was played in response to. For example, if your opponent plays Trip on their turn, targeting
					you, and you play Selective Autotomy in response, Trip doesn’t deal damage to you until after
					you have resolved Selective Autotomy.
					You do not have to declare the number of cards you will draw. You may look at each card as
					you draw it, and decide whether or not to continue drawing cards. For example, you could
					draw a card, look at it, decide it isn’t as good as you might have hoped, and choose to draw a
					second card.

				<h3>Set Bonsuses</h3>
				<div>
				<p>
					Allosaurus – Hatchet Chomp: When you attack, gain health equal to the damage done to
					your opponent.
					<br>
					Velociraptor - Clever Girl: When you attack, roll thrice and use the total as a single roll.
					<br>
					Quetzalcoatlus - King of the Sky: Gain 3 attack. When being attacked, if your attacker rolls
					higher than 3, you take no damage.
					<br>
					Spinosaurus - Death roll: When attacking, roll two die. If the second die comes up less than
					or equal to the first, roll another die. You may repeat this process until you roll higher than the
					preceding roll. Use the total of all rolls as your attack roll. We’re sorry the word “roll” appears
					so many times in this paragraph.
					<br>
					Dracorix – Rough and Tumble: If your attack deals damage, the target also takes damage
					equal to their weight.
					<br>
					Therizinosaurus - Claw Swipe: Any time your dinosaur attacks an opponent and deals
					damage, remove a part of your choice from the opponent’s dinosaur.
					<br>
					Tyrannosaurus - Apex Predator: Gain 10 attack.
					<br>
					Plesiosaurus - Aquatic Hunter: When you attack, act as though your opponent had a weight
					of 0.
					<br>
					Brontomerus - Long neck: You may choose to attack at the end of every turn, even if it is
					not your turn.
					<br>
					Stegosaurus - Thagomizer: Whenever you are attacked, even if you take no damage, your
					attacker takes 5 damage.
					<br>
					Triceratops - Cranial Combatant: When attacking, only take the weight of the defending
					Dinosaur's head into account when dealing damage.
					<br>
					Ankylosaurus - Super armor: Once per turn, when an opponent plays a card, you may
					choose to send that card to the discard pile. It does not take effect but still costs an action.
					Additionally, you only take damage from attacks; effect cards cannot damage you.
					<br>
					Apatosaurus - Super Heavy Weight: When attacking, calculate damage using your
					dinosaur’s weight, rather than its attack.
